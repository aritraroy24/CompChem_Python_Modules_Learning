# Similarities betweens List & NumPy Array
*   Both are used for storing datas
*   Both are mutable
*   Can be indexed and iterated through
*   Slicing operation can be performed on both of them

# Differences between List & NumPy Array
|List|Array|
|:---:|:----:|
|Can contain different datatypes|Can contain only one datatype|
|Mathematical operations can't be done on list|Mathematical calculations can be done|
|Built-in funcion|To use NumPy Array, we have to import NumPy library|

# Advantages of NumPy Array over List
*   Consumes less memory
*   Provides efficient storage
*   It is fast
*   Easy to learn
*   More convenient to use when we want to use mathematical operations and it provides better ways of handling data for processing
